## About

Capra is an experimental, event-based graphics/game engine focused on ease of use. Inspiration drawn from libraries such as PyGame for Python, and LOVE2D for Lua. Currently, there is more support being given to low-res/pixel art style graphics and primitives, but ideally in the future any kind of graphics will be supported.
